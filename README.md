## Pairwise Sequence Embedding

This is an experimental library for learning a similarity-preserving mapping of pairs of sequences of feature vectors to pairs of fixed-length embedded vectors.  Under active development, use at your own risk!  Requires bleeding-edge versions of [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) and [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne).

If you're looking for the code for the experiments from the ICASSP 2016 paper ["Pruning Subsequence Search with Attention-Based Embedding"](http://colinraffel.com/publications/icassp2016pruning.pdf), try [this tag](https://github.com/craffel/pse/releases/tag/v0.1.0).  The code for running those experiment now lives [here](https://github.com/craffel/midi-dataset/tree/master/experiments/pse).
